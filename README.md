Simplest way to host flask web apps in production - Using nginx and gunicorn.

## Installation
```
pip install airflask
```

## Features
- ðŸš€ One line production deployment for flask apps. 
- ðŸ”§ Installs all dependencies, and manages everything. 
- âš¡ Powered by a nginx + gunicorn server.



## Usage
**Deploying**: Just run this single line â€” it auto-installs all dependencies and your app goes live!

```
sudo airflask deploy <path>
```
- where `<path>` is the full path to the parent folder containing your app.py
- App will be hosted on your public ip address use `--private` if you have a shared public ip address.
- for eg. `sudo airflask deploy /home/naitik/flaskecomapp/`

## Deploying with Domain and SSL (Free SSL via Let's Encrypt)

```
sudo airflask deploy <path> --domain <example.com>
```

```
sudo airflask deploy <path> --domain <example.com> --ssl --noredirect
```

## Note
- Be sure to rename your main flask file to `app.py`
- Make sure your domain points to your ip address for functionality.
- `--ssl` will not work without a domain specified.
- by default if `--ssl` is specified all http requests will be redirected to https unless `--noredirect` is used.

## Stop or Restart
```
sudo airflask restart <path>
sudo airflask stop <path>
```
Restart your app after you make changes.
