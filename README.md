Simplest way to host flask web apps in production - Using nginx and gunicorn.

## Installation
```
pip install airflask
```

## Features
- ðŸš€ One line production deployment for flask apps. 
- ðŸ”§ Installs all dependencies, and manages everything. 
- âš¡ Powered by a nginx + gunicorn server.
- ðŸ¤– Auto-tunes the best hosting config based on your server specs.


## Usage
**Deploying**: A single line that manages everything and your app goes live with no hassle!

```
sudo airflask deploy <path>
```
> where `<path>` is the full path to the parent folder containing your app.py
> App will be hosted on localhost, your private and public ip address (if static and unshared).
> for eg. `sudo airflask deploy /home/naitik/flaskecomapp/`

## Deploying with Domain and SSL (Free SSL via Let's Encrypt)

```
sudo airflask deploy <path> --domain <example.com>
```

```
sudo airflask deploy <path> --domain <example.com> --ssl --noredirect
```

## Note
- Be sure to rename your main flask file to `app.py`
- Make sure your domain points to your ip address for functionality.
- `--ssl` will not work without a domain specified.
- by default if `--ssl` is specified all http requests will be redirected to https unless `--noredirect` is used.

## Specifying App Type
It is optional yet important to know which kind of web app you are trying to deploy for efficient hosting.

```
sudo airflask deploy <path> --domain <example.com> --type <app_type>
```
App type can be:
- `chatapp ` : web apps which use websockets (*other app types may cause web socket functionality to not work properly)
- `cpubound` : web apps which are heavily cpu dependent (AI/ML, other cpu focused work)

By *default* hosting is optimized for i/o bound websites (which are heavily DB, API and file management oriantated like `ecommerce`, `blog`, etc), no need to specify apptype .

## Specifying App Power

```
sudo airflask deploy <path> --power <high/low/med>
```
Based on the amount of traffic your app recieves you can decide if you want:
- >100> Active users - `low` power would be good for small servers.
- >1K> Active users - `med` power would be good for medium servers.
- >1K+ Active users - `high` power would be good for big servers.

## Stop or Restart
```
sudo airflask restart <path>
sudo airflask stop <path>
```
Restart your app after you make changes.
