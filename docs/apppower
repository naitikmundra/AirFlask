## Specifying App Power

```
sudo airflask deploy <path> --power <high/low/med>
```
Based on the amount of traffic your app recieves you can decide if you want:
- >100> Active users - `low` power would be good for small servers.
- >1K> Active users - `med` power would be good for medium servers.
- >1K+ Active users - `high` power would be good for big servers.
